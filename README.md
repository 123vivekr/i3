i3 - Unofficial Fork
=====================

This is a fork of [i3wm](http://www.i3wm.org), a tiling window manager for Linux. It is based on two patches provided by

* https://github.com/jeanbroid/i3
* https://github.com/o4dev/i3

to allow for configurable gaps between containers in i3. However, I've also included patches on my own which are listed below. If you want
to check out how you could use them, you could check out my [dotfiles repository](https://www.github.com/Airblader/dotfiles).

As a general note, the `gaps` branch currently has i3 4.8 merged into it, while `gaps-next` ie the equivalent of `i3/next` with my patches.


Installation
============

First, clone the repository and switch into that folder. From there, installing (and updating) i3 is as easy as `make && sudo make install`. The next time you log in, simply select i3 as the desktop environment in your login manager. If you don't use one, start i3 from your `.xinitrc` or similar (in this case, I'm sure you know what to do â€“ if not, google it).

When first compiling i3, you need to install a few dependencies. The following is a list of packages needed when compiling the `gaps` branch on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04:


````
apt-get install libxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libpango1.0-dev libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev \
  libyajl-dev libstartup-notification0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libev-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev
```

To compile `gaps-next`, you'll need the following as well:

````
apt-get install libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
```

This may vary for other distributions. If you have trouble compiling it, just open an issue to let me know.

New Features
============

gaps
----

Based on the patches provided by o4dev and jeanbroid, i3 supports gaps between containers. I extended those patches further to make changing the gaps size easier during runtime and also to expose more functionality for binding it to keys. The syntax for the i3 config is

````
gaps_size [plus|minus] <px>
```

So, for example, `gap_size 10` would simply set the size of the gaps to 10 pixels. On the other hand, `gap_size plus 5` would increase the current gap size without having to know how much it actually is.

Note that `gap_size 0` is basically equivalent to not using the gaps patch at all. This is the default value.


i3bar Background & Color
------------------------

i3bar now supports setting a background and border color for the individual blocks. Additionally, it can be specified which of the four sides should have a border. Simply pass the following values via JSON to i3bar:

* `background` [color] sets the background color
* `border` [color] sets the border color
* `border_top`, `border_bottom`, `border_left`, `border_right` [boolean] whether to draw a border on the specified side (defaults to `true`)

Example:

````
{ \
  "full_text": "example", \
  "color": "\#FFFFFF", \
  "background": "\#222222", \
  "border": "\#9FBC00", \
  "border_bottom": false \
}
```


Smart Borders
-------------

With the original patch from [i3-extras](https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras), I've made the smart border feature configurable. If activated, this patch will draw borders around a container only if it is not the only container in this workspace. It is disabled by default and can be activated with

````
smart_borders on
```
