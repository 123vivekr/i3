TODO list, in order of importance:

 * freely resizable (e.g. using your mouse, for now) percentage of rows/cols
 * document stuff!
 * more documentation!
 * debian package
 * initial release

TODO for later™:
 * think of some IPC mechanism, implement it
 * a command for toggling layouts
 * a command for toggling workspaces
 * floating
 * do something about xpdf, it doesn’t use _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN (but size hints?)
