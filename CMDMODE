- Command mode
---------------------

This is the grammar for the command mode (your configuration file uses these commands, too).

left  := <h> | <cursor-left>
right := <l> | <cursor-right>
up    := <j> | <cursor-up>
down  := <k> | <cursor-down>

where := <left|right|up|down> | <tag>
move  := <m>
snap  := <s>

cmd     := [ <times> ] [ <move> | <snap> ] <where>
with    := <w> { [ <times> ] <where> }+ <space> <cmd>
jump    := [ "<window class>[/<window title>]" | <workspace> [ <column> <row> ] ]
focus   := focus [ <times> ]
(travels the focus stack backwards the given amount of times (by default 1), so
 it selects the window which had the focus before you focused the current one when
 specifying "focus 1")
special := [ exec <path> | kill | exit | restart ]

input := [ <cmd> | <with> | <jump> | <focus> | <special> ]

you can cancel command mode by pressing escape anytime.

Some examples:

Select the window on the left:
h

Select the window two places on the left:
2h

Move window to the right:
ml

Move window and window on the bottom to the right:
wk ml
