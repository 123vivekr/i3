/*
 * To get the big concept: There are helper structures like struct Colorpixel or
 * struct Stack_Window. Everything which is also defined as type (see forward definitions)
 * is considered to be a major structure, thus important.
 *
 * Let’s start from the biggest to the smallest:
 * - An i3Screen is a virtual screen (Xinerama). This can be a single one, though two monitors
 *   might be connected, if you’re running clone mode. There can also be multiple of them.
 *
 * - Each i3Screen contains Workspaces. The concept is known from various other window managers.
 *   Basically, a workspace is a specific set of windows, usually grouped thematically (irc,
 *   www, work, …). You can switch between these.
 *
 * - Each Workspace has a table, which is our layout abstraction. You manage your windows
 *   by moving them around in your table. It grows as necessary.
 *
 * - Each cell of the table has a container, which can be in default or stacking mode. In default
 *   mode, each client is given equally much space in the container. In stacking mode, only one
 *   client is shown at a time, but all the titlebars are rendered at the top.
 *
 * - Inside the container are clients, which is X11-speak for a window.
